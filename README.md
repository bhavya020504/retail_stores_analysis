# retail_stores_analysis
A complete data analysis project built using Python Pandas, covering everything from data cleaning to advanced analytics.
This project is focused only on Pandas, showcasing your ability to handle, process, and analyze retail sales data.

 Project Overview

This project analyzes a retail store dataset containing orders, products, customer details, prices, and quantities.
The goal is to demonstrate strong skills in:

Data Cleaning

Data Transformation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Grouping and Aggregation

Time Series Analysis

Data Reshaping

Categorical Encoding

Handling Large Datasets

Vectorization & Apply Functions

Merging & Joins

This project is perfect for Data Analyst / Data Science internships and showcases all important Pandas skills.

 Dataset Description

Columns used in the dataset:

Order_ID

Date

Product

Category

Quantity

Price

Customer

City

Region

Age

Gender

A new column Sales is created as:

Sales = Quantity * Price

 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
